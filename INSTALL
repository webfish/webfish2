Expand the webfish.1.0.tar.gz file into a preferred directory:
       tar xzf webfish.1.0.tar.gz
A directory webfish.1.0 is created. It contains all the necessary code and an example code.

To run the program successfully, number of dependencies must be met:

Operating system:
       Ubuntu 10.10 were tested, but other versions of Linux and possibly MAC OS X might be
       supported as long as shell commands mv, rm, rmdir, fold, chmod, sort, cut, tr, awk,
       echo, grep, sed and wc are available. In MAC OS X hwprefs must be supported.

GNU Octave interpreter:
       The code was tested with GNU Octave 3.2.4 with Octave-Forge 'IO' package. Matlab
       should be supported but has not been thoroughly tested.

Gnuplot:
       Octave requires Gnuplot to generate figures. Version 4.4.0 is know to work with the
       program, but other versions are likely to be compatible.

NCBI BLAST:
       NCBI BLAST 2.2.21 needs to be installed and functional. Other versions were not
       tested but may be compatible. The path to the 'megablast' executable must be
       provided in the webfish.m file.

EMBOSS:
       Set of bioinformatics tools is used to perform restriction endonuclease binding
       site search. version 6.2.0 is supported and others are likely to be compatible too.
       REBASE enzyme database is required to perform the restriction endonuclease cuts.
       Obtain it from ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/ and process it with EMBOSS before use.

Primer3:
       Primer3 2.2.3 needs to be installed and functional. Other versions were not
       tested but may be supported without any guarantee, however 1.x.x versions are not
       supported. The path to the 'primer3_core' executable must be provided in the
       webfish.m file.

Formatted genome database:
       Formatted genome database. A raw genome database can be obtained from
       ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/. The database required to run the attached example is
       available at ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-64/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/. Download
       all files and format them using 'formatdb' included with NCBI BLAST:
             formatdb -i input_fasta_file -p F -o T
       Save the files in a directory and include this directory in the configuration file
       "tasks/IJK.conf" <organism> tag replacing spaces with underscores. For 
       instance, if the tag is <organism>homo sapiens</organism>, the directory containing
       the formated chromosomal sequences must be called "homo_sapiens".

Example run:
       * Install all the necessary software. For Ubuntu 10.10 this would require:
       	   sudo apt-get install octave3.2 octave-io gnuplot blast2
	   wget ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/proto.txt ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/withrefm.txt
	   sudo rebaseextract -infile withrefm.txt -protofile proto.txt
	   wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/files/primer3/2.2.3/primer3-2.2.3.tar.gz
	   tar xzf primer3-2.2.3.tar.gz; cd primer3-2.2.3/src; make all; make test
	       Last two lines can be replaced by sudo apt-get install primer3 in Ubuntu >11.04.
       * In the ./webfish.m file on line 52 change the blast_dir to the path of the NCBI
         megablast excecutable.
       * In the ./webfish.m file on line 54 change the primer3_dir to the path of the
         primer3_core excecutable created 
       * In the ./webfish.m file on line 60 change the genomes_dir to the path containing
       	 the directories with the formated genome databases. For instance if the formatted
	 databases are in the directory "./genomes/homo_sapiens/" it should say:
	 genomes_dir = '/genomes/';.
       * Run MATLAB.
       * Change to the directory containing webfish.m and execute it.
       * Results will appear in the folder ./tasks/IJK/
